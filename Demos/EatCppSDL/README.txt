This is the Eat game, written by Snoolas in C++ with SDL and SDL_ttf, so make sure you have those libraries installed on your machine before complaining it doesn't work.

The gamplay is quite self-explainitory, so I won't talk about it here. You can change a few options in the game:
Press "r" to toggle rubber mode where letting up on the keys does not stop Mr. Major Muchie's movement.

Press "b" to toggle boundsmode where there is a boundary around the screen you can't cross. Using this in combination with rubber mode can get you lost pretty easily, so:

Press "h" to put Mr. Major Munchie in the middle of the screen.

Also, press the period and comma keys to change the game speed. 

The game was originally coded for Windows and the binary is a Windows one, but under the Eat_Linux directory you will find a source file for linux and a readme. Those have only been tested on one Linux machine, so don't be surprised if they don't work for you. Make sure to read the readme before reporting problems with it.
