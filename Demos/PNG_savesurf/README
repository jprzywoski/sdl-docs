SaveSurf: an example on how to save a SDL surface in PNG
Copyright (C) 2006 Angelo "Encelo" Theodorou

Info
----
A quick and dirty example on how to save a SDL surface (loaded with SDL_image) in a PNG image using libpng.
It is *heavy* inspired by this post: http://www.libsdl.org/pipermail/sdl/2001-May/036068.html, written by Darren Grant in 2001 and meant to be a SDL_image patch.

The savescreen and the saveglscreen versions show how to make a png screenshot of what is currently on the screen, either in SDL software or GL hardware blitting mode.

Requirements
------------
- libSDL
- SDL_image
- libpng

Compiling
---------
$make

Notes
-----
This program is part of "Mars, Land of No Mercy" SDL examples, you can find other examples on http://marsnomercy.org/sdl_ex.php.
