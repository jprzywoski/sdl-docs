Due to the increased popularity of my little game, it seems I now have to write some documentation *shudder*.

Ok, the installation is still simple, just extract the .tar.bz2 and run make. Be sure to have SDL-devel, SDL_image-devel and SDL_mixer-devel installed. After the compiling is finished, you can start the game with ./SDLInvaders.

To play the game, you need the following keys:
q: quit
<-: move your ship left
->: move your ship right
space: fire
p: (un)pause

If you have special weapons (you get them by shooting the special alien on top), they are shown on top as R, S or B.
R is the rocket, it just flies straight ahead and destroys all (normal) aliens on it's way. It is fired by pressing the "r" key.
S is a seekrocket. It randomly chooses a (normal) alien as target and destroys it. It is fired by using "s".
B is a bomb. It just flies ahead and, when hitting an alien, it does not only destroy this (normal) alien but all (normal) aliens around as well. It's fired by the "b" key.

You can choose your weapon (if you got more than one) with the number keys.

You can also play with the mouse. Move it left and right to move your ship, left button fires, right button switches weapons.

The goal is simple: Shoot all invaders, don't let them shoot you, don't let them reach the bottom of the screen.
