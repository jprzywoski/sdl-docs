Copyright (C) 2004 Angelo "Encelo" Theodorou

Info
----
This is a little demo that uses SDL direct pixel blitting, SDL_mixer, SDL_ttf and threads.
The program makes use of threads even if it could work without, but this way the program is simpler and shows the basic usage of them under libSDL.

The chip module "Purple Shades" is by Hi-Lite/Scoopex.
