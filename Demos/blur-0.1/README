Title:          blur

Version:        0.1

Author:         Stephan Uhlmann <su@codewizards.org>

Description:    demo with some blurred "wire netted" 3d objects, spectrum analyzer
                (fft) and scopes for music, text effect

Requirements:   needs SDL, SDL_image and SDL_mixer libraries

Yet another demo done with the SDL ;-) I don't think I'll ever go back to SVGALib.
It features some 3d stuff I ported from my old pascal sources. I also has music.
Apart from the compulsory scopes there is a spectrum analyzer effect. I thank
Philip VanBaren for his nice FFT (Fast Fourier Transformation) algorithm. I hope it's
ok when I use it. I took the files from a program called "wav2fft" and there was no
statement about the license there. But I found another program called "freq"/"xfreq"
which included nearly the same files and they were GPLed there.
And this demo is my first one which has a "message" ;-)


The following command line parameters are supported:
 -h : help
 -v : version
 -window : run in window (not fullscreen)
 -music <file> : use specified music file (MOD, XM, IT, S3M) instead of
                 the included one


If the configure script fails to find your SDL library try one of the
following options recognized by configure:
  --with-sdl-prefix=PFX   Prefix where SDL is installed (optional)
  --with-sdl-exec-prefix=PFX Exec prefix where SDL is installed (optional)
  --disable-sdltest       Do not try to compile and run a test SDL program



Have fun,
Stephan
