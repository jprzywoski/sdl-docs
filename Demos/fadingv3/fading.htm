<h1>Fading</h1>

This little tutorial is about fading. This technique can be used to slowly let an image disappear from screen,
and most people (including myself) like it a lot because it is such a
smooth effect. The regular apprauch is that each frame during the fade, all
RGB values of the pixels get decreased by a certain amount, which makes the
screen become more and more dark.<br><br>

There are two disadvantages to this apprauch:
<ul>
<li>Pixel-operations are slow, especcialy when done in video memory</li>
<li>Pixel-operations depend on the bit depth. Each bit-dept (8, 15/16, 24,
32) needs it's own implementation</li>
</ul>
In this tutorial, I'd like to show another way to make a fade:
alphablending. In stead of making the screen-surface darker, we go blend a
black surface over it. If we slowly increase the aplha value from 0 (not visible
) to 255 (fully visible), the screen seems to get darker and darker,
simulating a fade.<br><br>

When this technique is beeing used on a modern videocard, where
alphablending is hardware accelerated, you have the fade almost for free,
and for each bit-dept. :-)<br><br>

Below you can download both the Win32 and Linux version of the little sample program.
They both include the sourcecode and the executable. To re-compile, you need the <a href="
http://www.libsdl.org">Simple DirectMedia Layer</a>, a cross-platform
game API.<br>

<ul>
<li>Download the <a href="fading.zip">Windows</a> version.</li>
<li>Download the <a href="fading.tgz">Linux</a> version. (Thanks to Jean-Christophe Duberga!)</li>
</ul><br>
