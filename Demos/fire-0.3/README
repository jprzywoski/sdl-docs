Title:		fire

Version:	0.3

Author:		Stephan Uhlmann <su@codewizards.org>

Description:	fire/flames with some other whirling effect.

Requirements:	needs SDL library

This is my first demo with the SDL. I know the effect is a bit old, but at
least it is fast (about 70% faster than the sdl-ported XFlame).

The following command line parameters are supported:
 -h : help
 -v : version
 -width <value> : width of the screen in pixels
 -height <value> : height of the screen in pixels
 -fullscreen : run in fullscreen video mode if possible

Width and height can be any value above 2x2 (I have 3700 fps then! ;-) ).

If the configure script fails to find your SDL library try one of the
following options recognized by configure:
  --with-sdl-prefix=PFX   Prefix where SDL is installed (optional)
  --with-sdl-exec-prefix=PFX Exec prefix where SDL is installed (optional)
  --disable-sdltest       Do not try to compile and run a test SDL program


Have fun,
Stephan
