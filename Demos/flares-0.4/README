Description:	graphics reacting to the music, alpha blending, scopes

Requirements:	needs SDL, SDL_image and SDL_mixer libraries

My second demo with the SDL. It's really good and fairly easy to code for it.
First time I use music (recently bought a new soundcard) and the SDL_mixer
library is nice. After so many years MODs still rock :-)
Thanks to v0x for his nice track "totally wikkid" I use in the demo, but you
can use your own music if you want (see command line options).
I need the SDL_image library because I use alpha channel and need to load
PNGs which are alpha aware.


The following command line parameters are supported:
 -h : help
 -v : version
 -window : run in window (not fullscreen)
 -music <file> : use specified music file (MOD, XM, IT, S3M) instead of
                 the included one
 

If the configure script fails to find your SDL library try one of the
following options recognized by configure:
  --with-sdl-prefix=PFX   Prefix where SDL is installed (optional)
  --with-sdl-exec-prefix=PFX Exec prefix where SDL is installed (optional)
  --disable-sdltest       Do not try to compile and run a test SDL program



Have fun,
Stephan
