JETPAC - THE RETURN

Compilation notes:

Simply type 'make' and the program should build automatically.  You will need
the SDL library from www.libsdl.org but if you use a recent version of Mandrake
or Red Hat it should already be installed and the makefile should work fine.

Installation notes:

Once the program has been 'made' change to root user by typing the following:
	su root
You will be prompted for a password.  Type in the root password.
Next type:
	make install
This will setup the directories and install the game.
Next, type 'jetpac' to play.
