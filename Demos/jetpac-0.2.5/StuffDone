Changed background (added another nebulae to make it slightly more colourful).

Changed the 'bag of gold' scoring icon so it looks nicer.

Added 'stage x' labels.  Game will now consist of levels containing 5 stages each.  After
the player has completed the 5 stages he/she will get a code for getting to the next level
without having to trudge through the previous levels all over again.

Added 'load level' button to the main menu to allow players to zoom to levels they have
previously achieved (and obtained the code for).

Added the ability for aliens to fire spores of all kinds (including homing spores).

The big alien from level 3 (I think it was) is now the end of level baddie for level 1
(stage 5).  I've also got rid of that annoying asteroid on that level.

Nick Glass tweaked the code so that it would be compatible with MS Visual C++
and he also got a Windows version working.

Joystick support added by Nick Glass.

Improved the level 2 baby alien sprite.

Improved the asteroid graphics.

Changed fuel drum to have leaky green fuel coming out of it.

Moved all graphics into a 'pixmaps' directory.  This just keeps the main
directory a little neater.

Started work on level 2.  Stage 1 implemented.

New level secret code display implemented.

New background for level 2 (its not that good yet, but I'll get round to making
it look nicer.)

Stopped player dying when falling.

Added some 'powerups'.  There is a thing that freezes all the aliens and theres
a more powerful gun that kills instantly. All work under a limited duration.
