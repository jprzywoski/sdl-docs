                       LIGHTNING
                       ---------

This is my first SDL program.  Me likey.

It simulates lightning with some pixel manipulations and some pretty good sound effects.  Let me know if you like it.

Here are some command like options:

-na	No audio
-f	Run in fullscreen
-h	Use a hardware surface
