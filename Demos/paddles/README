This is the Paddles pong clone by Snoolas. It uses the USE codebase which means virtually nothing. It shows SDL for general video
drawing and SDL_ttf for font rendering, as well as a basic but unorthodox implementation of pong physics. The ball has velocities and
there is friction that slows it down instead of just stopping abruptly when the keys are let up which makes for a much more realistic
pong experience, but it also makes for more bugs and stuff. The AI looks awful because it doesn't really understand the physics, but it
serves its purpose. It also has a few bugs that I know of. One is that when the ball starts going at more than 4 pixels/frame, there is
a chance that the ball will fly straigt through the paddles. I know exactly what causes it, but if you wanted to fix it at this point
without making it a dirty hack, you'd have to make major changes. I think. Anyhow, I want to move on to other things. :).

Anyway, this is the Linux version. The Windows version... Is delayed. You can use the inluded shell script to recompile the game. Yeah,
a shell script. That's how small this is. There is an included binary for x86 Linux, which should satisfy most people. It depends on
having SDL, SDL_ttf, and SDL_image and their dependencies installed.
