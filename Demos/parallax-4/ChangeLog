David Olofson - "Parallax Scrolling IV - Overdraw Elimination +"

	+ Implemented merging of horizontal runs.

	+ Removed the -p option, as it has no effect.
	  (It just sets the default; "use planets".)


David Olofson - "Parallax Scrolling III - Overdraw Elimination"

	+ Added GPL license notice and "COPYING".

	+ Wrote makefile.

	+ Split main.c into
		parallax3.c
		parallax3.h
		HISTORY

	+ Added clip rect argument to layer_render().

	+ Arranged parallax layers in a linked list.

	+ Shortened tiled_layer_t to layer_t, and renamed
	  the tl_* methods to layer_*.

	+ Made layer_render() do a recursive call to the
	  underlying layer when it hits a transparent tile.

	+ layer_link() now tells layer_animate() what to do,
	  rather than requiring the application to call
	  layer_link() instead of layer_animate(). The same
	  for layer_limit_bounce();

	+ The opaque tiles are now rendered from a surface
	  that's not RLE accelerated. This should speed up
	  clipping for those tiles slightly.

	+ Added recursion and rendering statistics.

	+ Added options:
		-l<n>	Use <n> layers (default = 7)
		-b	"Bounce-around" mode
		-w	Wrap maps instead of bouncing
		-a<n>	Alpha for non-opaque tiles = <n>
		-v<n>	Verbosity level <n> (default = 0)
		-p	Use planet layers (default)
		-np	Don't use planet layers

	+ Arrows + shift moves and scales root clip rect.


David Olofson - "Parallax Scrolling Example 2"

	+ Created C style "class" tiled_layer_t.

	+ " " in the map == no tile.

	+ Added a third parallax layer with it's own map.

	+ The background got a map.

	+ Removed the confusing initialization of the
	  destination SDL_Rect size in draw_tile()...

	+ Added vertical scrolling; map size 16x16.

	+ Corrected my bounce code! (Moving back to the
	  previous position iswrong*. "Mirroring" over
	  the limit is the correct way. Silly me... :-)

	+ Tweaked the graphics a bit. The planet is now
	  circular rather than 320x200 ratio compensated.

	+ Rewrote the rendering loop in a (hopefully)
	  more comprehensible way.

	+ Exit handled more properly.

	+ Command line options added:
		-f	Fullscreen
		-d	Double buffer
		-<n>	Depth = <n> bits


Randi J. Relander - "Parallax Scrolling Example"

	+ Added simple 2-layer parallax scrolling with
	  layer velocities expressed in pixels/sec.


David Olofson - "Tiled Map Scrolling Example"

	+ Added a simple map, and replaced the image with
	  a tile palette. Graphics borrowed from David's
	  (so far) unreleased game "Project Spitfire".

	+ Fixed atexit() bug.


Nghia - "Simple Scrolling Example"

	+ Basic continuous scrolling of an image.
