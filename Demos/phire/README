  Introduction
--============

Well, there isn't much to say. I have seen many pixel-based flame effects
around and my idea was to write a particle-based flame effect. This is what
you are holding in your hands. It probably isn't the best solution, but it
works and draws some elliptic shapes that look like something you would call
fire. =)

It is based on SDL and doubly-linked lists, which I have developed myself.
For performance reasons I have also written the pseudo-random number
generator myself. It works with additions and bit operations only, so it is
very fast (370 million numbers/sec on my Duron 1.6 GHz machine).

Since the program is released under the GNU GPL, you can, with a few
limitations, do whatever you want with any part of the source code. Read the
GPL for further informations. If you still have any questions regarding
licensing, just email me and I'll help you.

If you have problems or want to report a bug, see the Troubleshooting section
below.

Enjoy. =)



  Installation
--============

Firstly you need to unpack the bzip2'ed tarball. Since you are reading this
file, I assume you have already done this. I've supplied a Makefile, which
does all the dirty work for you. Just run:

 make

from the root directory of this package and the program will get compiled to
a binary. If you feel like wasting space, you can also install it:

 make install

If you later want to make more valuable use of your space, you can uninstall
it afterwards:

 make uninstall



  Invocation
--==========

Just run the "phire" binary located in the "src" subdirectory, when the
compilation is finished without errors:

 src/phire

If you have installed it, then you can also just say:

 phire

If you want to run this program in fullscreen mode or change the resolution,
call the program with the -h option, which will provide you with a little
usage help text:

 src/phire -h

or:

 phire -h



  Troubleshooting
--===============

First of all: the SDL library must be installed properly for this program to
work. If this is not the case, then go to <http://www.libsdl.org/> and see
the installation instructions for the SDL library.

Remember that most distributions already have the SDL library as a package.
At least this is true for Debian and Gentoo.


1. If the "SDL/SDL.h" file cannot be found

This is a portability problem, if SDL is installed properly on your site. For
now, you need to look for the SDL.h file, which might be located in
/usr/include. If it's there, you need to open the source code files (*.cpp
and *.h) and change all lines that look like this:

 #include <SDL/SDL.h>

to this:

 #include <SDL.h>

Remember that Unix/Linux are case-sensitive. So if your SDL header file is
named sdl.h instead of SDL.h, then you need to change it appropriately in the
source code files.


2. Other problems

Most problems are already covered in the FAQ section at
<http://www.libsdl.org/>. Please look there first, before asking me
questions.


3. Reporting bugs

Just drop me an email. See below for contact information.



  Contact
--=======

If you have a question, a problem (which is not already covered in the
Troubleshooting section), if you want to report a bug or just want to feed
something back, you can email me at <never@drwxr-xr-x.org>.

I'm also on IRC with the nickname "mm_freak". Join <#mm> on

I understand both English and German, but I prefer German. =)
