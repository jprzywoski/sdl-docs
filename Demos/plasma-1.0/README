Plasma demo by Bini Michele <mibin@tin.it>, Aug 1998. Public domain.
Coding time: ~5 hours.

TODO:
 - timing (currently the demo only runs at full speed).
 - better support for non-palettized displays?
 - mmx optimizations? (the main task of the code is summing three tables,
and mmx instructions could help).
