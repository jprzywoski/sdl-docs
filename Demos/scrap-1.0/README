Title:   scrap
Copying: Freeware

This is a demo of cut-paste within the SDL environment.
- It works under X11 and Win32, with text between all applications
  and images between SDL applications.

/* This program demonstrates that it is possible to use SDL along with the
   native windowing system -- this program gives you access to the clipboard

   - Click the left mouse button in the window to set the clipboard text to
        "SDL-\n-scrap"

   - Giving the program a BMP file on the command line will cause it to place
     the image in the clipboard and then display it
*/
