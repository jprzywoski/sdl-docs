Screen Art- A little bit of dizzying eye candy SDL demo. Version 1.1.1 (8/1/2001)

This program is intended to be a demonstration of SDL, the Simple
DirectMedia Layer.

Compiling the demo:

Run 'make'

Running the demo :

Once the program is compiled, just run "screenart" and enjoy.

The demo runs on its own, you can exit it by pressing any key.

Background :

I had actually written some screen art for full screen mode a long time ago.
This screen art uses the same algorithms as the old code.
This is my first attempt at using SDL.
