I learned a lot from koules (an excellent game written by Jan Hubicka).
I learned most of what I know about XWindows by looking at his code. Also
the sound player is a modified version of the one in koules. Kevin Oster
and Alex Morando designed a lot of the levels, but most of them are mine.
Ron Hunsinger figured out the algorithms for enemy movement--they match
the real Lode Runner exactly.

Marcus Brinkman <Marcus.Brinkmann@ruhr-uni-bochum.de> has adopted xscavenger
and is taking care of the debian maintenance. He also cleaned up the code
in a lot of places to prevent lint-warnings. Thanks for your efforts, Marcus!

Thanks to Sam Lantinga for his SDL library. For what it's worth I can take
the same codebase and get it working on win32 now using the SDL lib.
