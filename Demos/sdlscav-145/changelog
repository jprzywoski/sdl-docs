Scavenger and this changelog file were written by David Ashley.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version is 1.4.5
Improved the operation of the SDL version and added loads of new features.
See the NEW_FEATURES file for a full list.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version is still 1.3.7
Sun Aug 22 09:50:41 PDT 1999
Finished up SDL version of scavenger. Works under windoze now too.
Fixed an old bug in the resource code which left open filehandles around.
This was preventing deleting the levels.scl file under windoze. Ripped out
the old sound server mechanism and used SDL threads for sound, taking my
sound driver from my sdlbomber game.

Version is 1.3.7
Dave Ashley: Hwei Sheng TEOH <hsteoh@cs.toronto.edu> sent me some new
artwork and a modified scav.c file to show some animation during digging.
Every bit helps :^). Thanks Hwei!

Version is 1.3.6
Dave Ashley:  Daniel de RAUGLAUDRE, daniel.de_rauglaudre@inria.fr,
http://pauillac.inria.fr/~ddr/   found a bug in the movie generation that
I'm surprised no one ever noticed. It turns out every time you finished a
level you would be the previous best score, and your new movie would be
saved. Now the movie should only be saved if you actually did get a better
score. Daniel also added F7 for previous level, similiar to F8 going to
next level. Thanks Daniel!

Sat Jun  6 11:43:26 PDT 1998
Version is 1.3.5
Dave Ashley: fixed problem in scavserver.c, if the /dev/dsp file cannot be
opened, the scavserver task just lingers and never exits. I changed it so
it will do everything normally, just not try to write to the filehandle
associated with the sound device. Also the error message is more helpful:
scavserver: Couldn't open DSP /dev/dsp, you must play without sound.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May 27 14:00:07 PDT 1998
Version is still 1.3.4
Dave Ashley: Fixed minor quirk in edit.c, in the level editor the fill type
was not drawn with a box around it correctly. Relavent routines are ebox0
and ebox1.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun May 24 12:26:10 PDT 1998
Version is 1.3.4
Dave Ashley: Fixed bug discovered by Hwei Sheng TEOH <hsteoh@cs.toronto.edu>.
The bug would surface when you'd replay a level, the movie wouldn't be
recorded correctly. The problem was that during a recording (when you're
actually playing), if a movie exists the first movement count would get
corrupted. The movies are stored as a series of count,action pairs. Had to
fix the initplay() routine in scav.c.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May  6 11:33:54 PDT 1998
Version is 1.3.3
Dave Ashley: Made changes contributed by Eivind Eklund <eivind@yes.no>, sorry
to be so late about it Eivind! Anyway:
1) Supposedly works under FreeBSD.
2) Supposed to check for disk full when writing out level resource file.
3) If no sound card exists, scavserver exits gracefully (no core dump).
Thanks, Eivind!

Version is 1.3.2
Dave Ashley: Changed x.c and anim.c so the animator should work with 8 bit,
16 bit, 24 bit and 32 bit modes ok. Originally it only worked right with
8 bit mode.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Dec 17 17:51:00  PST 1997
Version is still 1.3.1
Dave Ashley: Marcus wants me to adopt his version as the "official"
xscavenger so I've checked all his changes out and am now putting it up on
my web page. It looks like what he did was to run lint or equivalent on all
the source files, and fix all the niggling compiler warnings...There are 100's
of little changes made, but it doesn't look like he installed some evil
virus :^).
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Dec  6 18:02:00  1997
Version is now 1.3.1
Marcus Brinkmann: I extracted header files for correct proty type
declaration. I corrected the include statements and some other stuff as
explicit type declarations. Doing this reduced the warnings the compiler
gave with "-Wall" down to five. Note that the header files are maximal,
means there are to many extern declarations. Perhaps I will fix this later.

I also added a provisoric manpage scavenger.6, which gets not automagically
installed (even with make install.man), because I don't know how to set
section 6 with the Imakefile.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu May  8 18:30:19  1997
Version is now 1.3
I fixed it so F10 in the menu (which you get after hitting space in demo
mode) lets you remap keys. Lots of people have had to manually change
the $HOME/.scavenger/scavrc file as my defaults are not universal.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Apr 29 17:13:10  1997
Version is now 1.2
I modified the x.c file as per instructions from Jan Schoenepauck
<schoenep@uni-wuppertal.de> so that the game runs in 16/24/32 bits per pixel
mode. It works ok (I only tried it in 8bpp and 24bpp) but there are new
problems introduced:
1) The animator display is completely messed up. The animator is unusable
   in anything but 8 bit mode. Fixing this will require figuring out how
   to fake color table stuff when there is no color table. I doubt if many
   people use the animator anyway, so it's not a critical issue. And if
   you really need the animator, switch to an 8 bit display.
2) The level editor display is supposed to have a box around the selected
   tile type. This doesn't work properly in 16/24/32 modes, it appears as
   if none of the tiles is selected.

I'm lazy so don't want to spend the time fixing these just yet.

Mon Apr 28 16:46:34  1997
Version is now 1.1
Thomas Haller <tha@vsnhd5.cern.ch> compiled Scavenger on an Amiga Linux
system, and found all the keycodes are different so none of the controls
worked. He modified his copy of the source so it would work, but this is
only a partial fix since each different implementaion of Linux/X has
different definitions for the keycodes. I'm copying Koules again and using
the XLookupKeysym() function, then using the equates in the <X11/keysymdef.h>
file, so it should work across all platforms with a recompile.

If you want to upgrade to this version from an older version, you will have
to delete the ~/.scavenger/scavrc file, or fix up the keycodes for the
up, down, left, right, digleft and digright. Deleting the scavrc file will
cause scavenger to create a new one. Find new heycodes in the
<X11/keysymdef.h> file.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Apr 25 20:41:50  1997
I installed the Imakefile stuff and modified the README file. Thanks to
Adam Jenkins <ajenkins@cs.umass.edu> for making the Imakefile!
Adam made the vga_tetris game that uses the svgalib. It's available on
sunsite.unc.edu in /pub/Linux/games/arcade
