Spiralizer is a simple 'gillion-lines-on-screen' spiral demo,
written in C++ using SDL. It is free(as in freedom) software,
and is licensed under the GNU General Public License(see
LICENSE for details).

This version works similar to screensavers, in the sence that
once the program is started it is not interactive; pressing
any button on the mouse or keyboard will exit the program.

Some additional features can be accessed using command line
parameters, see 'spiralizer --help' for details.

This program uses a 256 color depth screen and a BMP image
to load the palette from. Each row in this image represents
one palette, of which the 256 left-most pixels are read into
a palette. If a palette number is not provided in the command
line arguments, it will be randomly selected.

Even I(w00t!?) make occasional mistakes in the code, so comments
and suggestions are welcome as long as they remain proper. Please
post them to the spiralizer project page:
	http://sourceforge.net/projects/spiralizer
or I can be e-mailed directly:
