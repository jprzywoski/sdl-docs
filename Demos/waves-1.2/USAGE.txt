this small demo is about liquid surface modelling.


mouse:

use mouse to move on the surface. while
you hold down first mouse button and move
trace is left behind.


keys:

1 2 - smooth
q w - gravity
a s - friction
z x - elastics
f - fullscreen
space - clear
esc - quit


meanings of properties:

smooth - how much to smooth the surface?
	smaller value gives better smoohing.
	a stupid param, probly you wont notice
	any change.

gravity - smaller value increases process sped.

friction - how long the oscillation will last?
	smaller value means longer.

elastics - wave length. smaller values - longer wave.


when you go with some parameter out of optimal range
system starts to amplify waves. sometimes this gives
very nice-looking patterns. when this happend bring
the value back to optimal range (and press space).
